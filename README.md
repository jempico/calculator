A calculator built with Vanilla JavaScript that functions and looks like an iPhone calculator (currently WIP);

Things I've learned:
1. How to create and use custom data attributes to store values.
2. How to structure the code and clean it up in order to achieve a simple, readable and predictable program.
3. How to build the 'happy path':  what the average person would do when they pick up a calculator.
4. How to define different Edge Cases and solve them.
