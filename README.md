A calculator that functions and looks like an iPhone calculator.

Things I've learned:
1. How to access to custom data attributes (data-*) on elements with the dataset property.
2. How to build the 'happy path':  what the average person would do when they pick up a calculator.
2. How to layout the buttons and container combining flex and grid.
3. How to create and use data-* type attributes to describe what each key does.
4. How to clean up the code.

For the future:
- Implement horizontal view.
- Make keyboard inputs work with the calculator.
