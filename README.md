A calculator that functions and looks like an iPhone calculator.

Things I've learned:
1. How to propperly structure the JavaScript functionalities behind a calculator.
2. How to layout the buttons and container combining flex and grid.
3. How to create and use data-* type attributes to describe what each key does.
4. How to clean up the code.

For the future:
- Implement horizontal view.
- Make keyboard inputs work with the calculator.
