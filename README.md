A calculator built with Vanilla JavaScript that functions and looks like an iPhone calculator (currently WIP);

Things I've learned:
1. How to design a program combining inmutable variables with custom data attributes.
2. How inmutability helps writing simple, readable and predictable code.
3. How to build the 'happy path':  what the average person would do when they pick up a calculator.
4. How to clean up the code.

To be done:
- Define different Edge Cases and solve them.
